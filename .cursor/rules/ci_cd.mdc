# CI and CD
- GitHub Actions runs linting, typing, and tests on all pushes and PRs.
- Pre-commit hooks include black with line length 88, isort, flake8, mypy, and YAML validation.
- Run tests in parallel when safe.
- Clean up resources such as browser contexts, API sessions, and temp files via fixtures.
